Hello everyone!

My name is Anna Griffith and I am a comp sci major with a minor in business. I was raised in Bay City, TX then relocated to Conway, AR before I decided to go to Lyon. 
I drive a yellow volkswagen beetle and I cheer for the Lyon Scots. My brother, Chase, is also a comp sci student at Lyon.
